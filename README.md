# Weather App

This is a weather app built using Vue.js that allows users to search for cities, view the history of searched cities, and clear the search history. Users can also search for locations, add them to favorites, delete favorites, and identify their own geolocation. The app provides various weather data for each city, including the current temperature, hourly temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

## Features

- **City Search:** Users can search for cities to view their weather information.
- **Search History:** The app keeps a record of the searched cities, allowing users to quickly access their weather information again.
- **Clear History:** Users have the option to clear the search history.
- **Location Search:** Users can search for locations and view their weather data.
- **Favorites:** Users can add locations to their favorites for quick access.
- **Delete Favorites:** Users can remove locations from their favorites.
- **Geolocation:** The app can identify the user's current geolocation and display the weather information for that location.
